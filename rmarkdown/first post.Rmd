# Hello World

Here is my first try at using [github pages](https://github.io/) and rmakrdown to blog some of my work. My first few blog posts are going to be a mess but hopefully over time they will get better :)

# Sample Code

## R Code

```{r}
print("Hello World!")
```

## Plot

```{r}
# Creating a Graph
attach(mtcars)
plot(wt, mpg) 
abline(lm(mpg~wt))
title("Regression of MPG on Weight")
```

That's it!
